# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
In an attempt to see the connection between the tectonic plates and earthquakes, we created a map that allows overlays of the earthquake and tectonic plates data. There is also a need to add in an overlay for only the major earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 so that major earthquakes can get a better visual. In addition to these data that need to added, map styles were also added to create options of visual appearances that may be suited best to show the data.

In the images above, it shows two of the different styles of map box styles that was added to the map that may be selected. In addition to this, these maps show the tectonic plate data and earthquake data was added correctly as an overlay so that the sizes and colors of the circles correlates to the magnitude of the earthquakes.


## Summary

Through the imagery of the maps created, we are able to see a direct correlation between the tectonic plates and earthquakes. The earthquakes not only tend to be more frequent nearing the tectonic plates but also more likely to be large earthquakes. Although earthquakes do appear away from the tectonic plates, they are rarer and mostly minor. Something else that may be instresting that may be worth looking into is why certain earthquakes away from the tectonic plates occur frequently in certain places; an example of this would be the earthquakes over the border of Texas in the images of the maps above.
