# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
In an attempt to see the connection between the tectonic plates and earthquakes, we created a map that allows overlays of the earthquake and tectonic plates data. There is also a need to add in an overlay for only the major earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 so that major earthquakes can get a better visual. In addition to these data that need to added, map styles were also added to create options of visual appearances that may be suited best to show the data.
